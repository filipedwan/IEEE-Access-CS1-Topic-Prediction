# IEEE-Access-CS1-Topic-Prediction

One major issue with Online Judges is that problems are often put together without any associated meta-information that could, for example, be used to help classify problems. This meta-information could be extremely valuable to help users quickly find what types of problems they need most. In this work, we propose and validate a predictive model that can automatically detect fine-grained topics of problems based on the CS1 syllabus. After experimenting with many shallow and deep learning models with different word representations based on cutting-edge NLP techniques, our best model is a CNN, achieving an F1-score of 88.9%. Our model can be used for various applications, including (i) facilitating the search process of problems for CS1 learners and instructors and (ii) how it can be integrated into a system to recommend problems in OJs. 

The dataset and code related to our paper can be accessed in this repository.
